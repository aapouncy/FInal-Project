# Our First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-04-17

Welcome to our _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, we will share our learning journey as we build a new website.

## What We've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, we created a new Astro project and set up our online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: We then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is our first blog post! we now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

We will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
